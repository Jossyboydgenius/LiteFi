Your privacy is important to us. We are committed to safeguarding your personal information and handling it with care and transparency.

                This policy applies to all personal data collected through our website (litefi.ng), mobile applications, physical application forms, and any other means through which you interact with LiteFi Limited. We operate in Nigeria and are committed to complying with the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) 2023, the Lagos State Money Lenders Law, and other relevant Nigerian laws and regulations. As privacy expert Daniel J. Solove noted, "Privacy is not about having something to hide. It is about having something to protect." For LiteFi, that protection underpins our operations.

                This policy applies to all personal data processed by LiteFi Limited, regardless of the method or location of collection and storage. This includes, but is not limited to, data relating to our past, present, and prospective clients, employees, contractors, suppliers, and any other individuals whose personal data we handle.

                The NDPA 2023, as clarified by the GAID 2025, has an extraterritorial application, meaning it protects personal data of individuals within Nigeria, those whose data has been transferred to Nigeria, or data in transit through Nigeria, and even Nigerian citizens abroad under certain conditions.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                LiteFi Limited upholds the core principles for processing personal data as stipulated in the NDPA 2023. These principles guide all our data handling practices:
              </p>
              <div className="ml-4 mb-4">
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">3.1 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. This involves clearly identifying a valid lawful basis for processing, such as the data subject's consent, contractual necessity, legal obligation, vital interests, public task, or our legitimate interests, ensuring the data subject is fully informed. We ensure consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, without relying on silence or inactivity.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">3.2 Purpose Limitation</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Personal data is collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes. We do not process data in a manner incompatible with the original stated purposes. For example, personal information gathered for a service agreement will not be used for unrelated marketing without explicit and separate consent.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">3.3 Data Minimisation</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We only collect personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. Our processes are designed to avoid the collection of excessive or irrelevant data.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">3.4 Accuracy</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We strive to ensure personal data is accurate, complete, non-misleading, and kept up-to-date. We implement mechanisms for individuals to correct or update their information and promptly rectify or erase inaccurate data upon discovery or notification.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">3.5 Storage Limitation</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Personal data is not retained for longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. Our data retention schedules are regularly reviewed to ensure compliance with this principle. The GAID 2025 suggests a default deletion within six months after fulfilling the original purpose if no time-bound obligation exists.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">3.6 Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We process personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate security against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. This is achieved through robust technical and organisational measures, protecting data availability, confidentiality, and integrity.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">3.7 Accountability</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  LiteFi Limited is responsible for demonstrating compliance with the NDPA principles. We maintain records of our data processing activities, implement data protection by design and default, and conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) where processing is likely to result in a high risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Under the NDPA 2023, individuals have enhanced rights regarding their personal data. LiteFi Limited fully supports and facilitates the exercise of these rights:

                  Individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data. Our privacy notices are designed to be clear, concise, and easily accessible, providing all required information as per NDPA Section 27.

                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">4.2 Right of Access (Subject Access Request - SAR)</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Individuals can request confirmation of whether their personal data is being processed, and if so, access to that data and related information about the processing purposes, categories of data, recipients, retention periods, and source. We will respond to SARs promptly, typically within one month.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Individuals have the right to request the correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data. We will rectify data without undue delay upon verification.

                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">4.4 Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Individuals can request the deletion or removal of their personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. This applies in specific situations, such as when data is no longer necessary for its original purpose or consent is withdrawn.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">4.5 Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Individuals have the right to request the restriction of processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, for example, if they contest the accuracy of the data or object to its processing. When restricted, data can only be stored, not actively processed.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">4.6 Right to Data Portability</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Individuals have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit that data to another data controller without hindrance. This right applies to data processed by automated means based on consent or a contract.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">4.7 Right to Object</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Individuals have the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain situations, including processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing. We will cease processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override the individual's interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">4.8 Rights in relation to Automated Decision Making and Profiling</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Individuals have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects concerning them or significantly affects them. LiteFi Limited ensures appropriate safeguards, including human intervention and the right to express one's point of view.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">4.9 Special Protections for Vulnerable Data Subjects</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The GAID 2025 introduces a regime for vulnerable data subjects (e.g., children, elderly, persons with disabilities). Where a data subject is a child or lacks legal capacity, LiteFi Limited will obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian and implement appropriate age and consent verification mechanisms, utilising available technology. All processing involving children will be consistent with Nigeria's Child Rights Act 2003.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                LiteFi Limited maintains a comprehensive data retention schedule, ensuring that personal data is kept only for as long as necessary to fulfil its original purpose or to meet legal and regulatory obligations. For instance, financial records are generally retained for six years. Employee records are retained for a period consistent with labour laws. When data is no longer required, it is securely disposed of using methods appropriate to its format (e.g., cross-shredding for physical documents, secure wiping or degaussing for digital media). The GAID 2025's guidance on deleting data within six months post-purpose, where no other time-bound obligation exists, is strictly observed.
